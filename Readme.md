# Decentralized Class Roster

## 1. Project Title
**Decentralized Class Roster â€“ A Clarity Smart Contract**

## 2. Project Description
This Clarity smart contract provides a blockchain-based solution for maintaining a class roster in a decentralized manner.  
The contract allows only the **owner** to add or remove student addresses from the class list, ensuring that the records are tamper-proof and verifiable on-chain.

## 3. Project Vision
To create a transparent and secure system for managing student enrollments in educational institutions using blockchain technology.  
By eliminating centralized control, we ensure that academic records remain consistent, traceable, and resistant to unauthorized changes.

## 4. Future Scope
- **View Functions** to list all students in the roster.
- **Role-Based Access Control** to allow teachers to manage specific classes.
- **Integration with Decentralized ID (DID)** for identity verification.
- **Course Enrollment** linking students to multiple subjects.
- **Event Logging** to track additions/removals historically.
